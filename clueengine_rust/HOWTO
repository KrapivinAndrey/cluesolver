test
----
Here's an easy way to interactively test the CGI server which I learned from https://github.com/rory/rust-cgi:

- cargo build --bin cgi_server
- Copy from targets/debug/cgi_server to cgi-bin/cgi_server
- python -m http.server --cgi

Now from a separate command prompt run
    curl http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/cgi_server

benchmark
---------
cargo bench --bench simulate_fewconstraints

profile
-------
cargo flamegraph --bin simulation_fewconstraints
  (doesn't work though, even on linux running as root)
